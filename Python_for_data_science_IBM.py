Branching (if else elif statements)
Branching allows us to run different statements for different inputs

# If statement example
age = 19
#expression that can be true or false
if age > 18:
    #expression that is run if the condition is true
    print("you can enter" ) #you can enter
#The statements after the if statement will run regardless if the condition is true or false 
print("move on")

#The else statement runs a block of code if none of the conditions are True before it 
# Else statement example
age2 = 18

if age2 > 18:
    print("you can enter" )
else:
    print("go see Meat Loaf" ) # go see Meat Loaf
print("move on")

#The elif statement, short for else if, allows us to check
#additional conditions if the condition statements before it are False

# Elif statment example
age3 = 18

if age3 > 18:
    print("you can enter" )
elif age3 == 18:
    print("go see Pink Floyd")
else:
    print("go see Meat Loaf" )

print("move on")

if album_year > 1980:
    print("Album year is greater than 1980")
else:
    print("less than 1980")

print('do something..')

# Logical operators
# used when you want to compare more than one condition
# and, or, not
#The and statement is only True when both conditions are true
# Condition statement example
album_year3 = 1990

if(album_year3 < 1980) or (album_year3 > 1989):
    print ("Album was not made in the 1980's")

#Functions in Python

#Functions
#There are two types of functions :
#Pre-defined functions
#User defined functions
#What is a Function?
#You can define functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python:

#Functions blocks begin def followed by the function name and parentheses ().
#There are input parameters or arguments that should be placed within these parentheses.
#You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.
#There is a body within every function that starts with a colon (:) and is indented.
#You can also place documentation before the body.
#The statement return exits a function, optionally passing back a value

#First function example: Add 1 to a and store as b
def add(a):
    """
    add 1 to a
    """
    b = a + 1
    print(a, "if you add one", b)
    return(b)

# Get a help on add function
help(add)  #add 1 to a

# Call the function add()
add(1)  #1 if you add one 2

# Call the function add()
add(2)  #2 if you add one 3


# Define a function for multiple two numbers
def Mult(a, b):
    c = a * b
    return(c)
    print('This is not printed')
result = Mult(12,2)
print(result) #24

# Use mult() multiply two integers
Mult(2, 3) #6

# Use mult() multiply two floats
Mult(10.0, 3.14) #31.40

# Use mult() multiply two different type values together
Mult(2, "Michael Jackson ")
# But later in a program it can cause us an issues since it will expect integers and get strings

#Variables
#The input to a function is called a formal parameter
#A variable that is declared inside a function is called a local variable. 
#The parameter only exists within the function (i.e. the point where the function starts and stops).
#A variable that is declared outside a function definition is a global variable, 
#and its value is accessible and modifiable throughout the program. We will discuss more about global variables at the end of the lab.

# Function Definition
def square(a):
    # Local variable b
    b = 1
    c = a * a + b
    print(a, "if you square + 1", c) 
    return(c)

#If there is no return statement, the function returns None
def MJ():
    print('Michael Jackson')
    
def MJ1():
    print('Michael Jackson')
    return(None)
# See the output
MJ()
MJ1()

#Create a function con that concatenates two strings using the addition operation:
# See what functions returns are
print(MJ())
print(MJ1())

#Functions Make Things Simple
#Consider the two lines of code in Block 1 and Block 2: the procedure for each block is identical. 
#The only thing that is different is the variable names and values

#Block 1:
# a and b calculation block1
a1 = 4
b1 = 5
c1 = a1 + b1 + 2 * a1 * b1 - 1
if(c1 < 0):
    c1 = 0 
else:
    c1 = 5
c1   

#Block 2:
# a and b calculation block2
a2 = 0
b2 = 0
c2 = a2 + b2 + 2 * a2 * b2 - 1
if(c2 < 0):
    c2 = 0 
else:
    c2 = 5
c2   

#A function combines many instructions into a single line of code
#Once a function is defined, it can be used repeatedly
# Make a Function for the calculation above
def Equation(a,b):
    c = a + b + 2 * a * b - 1
    if(c < 0):
        c = 0 
    else:
        c = 5
    return(c) 


#Pre-defined functions

#The print() function
album_ratings = [10.0, 8.5, 9.5, 7.0, 7.0, 9.5, 9.0, 9.5] 
print(album_ratings)

# sum() adds every element in a list or tuple together
sum(album_ratings)

# Show the length of the list or tuple
len(album_ratings)

#Using if/else Statements and Loops in Functions

# Function example
# "return" statement is very useful 
def type_of_album(artist, album, year_released):
    
    print(artist, album, year_released)
    if year_released > 1980:

def PrintList(the_list):
    for element in the_list:
        print(element)

PrintList(['1', 1, 'the man', "abc"]) #1, 1, the man, abc

#Setting default argument values in your custom functions
#You can set a default value for arguments in your function. 
#isGoodRating() function create a threshold: 
#Perhaps by default, we should have a default rating of 4

# Example for setting param with default value

#Global variables
# Example of global variable
artist = "Michael Jackson" #Global varaible 
def printer1(artist):
    internal_var1 = artist #local variable 
    print(artist, "is an artist")
printer1(artist)

#Scope of a Variable
#The scope of a variable is the part of that program where that variable is accessible 
#Variables that are declared outside of all function definitions, 
#such as the myFavouriteBand variable in the code shown here, 
#are accessible from anywhere within the program

# Example of global variable
myFavouriteBand = "AC/DC"
def getBandRating(bandname):
    if bandname == myFavouriteBand:
        return 10.0
    else:
        return 0.0
print("AC/DC's rating is:", getBandRating("AC/DC"))
print("Deep Purple's rating is:",getBandRating("Deep Purple"))
print("My favourite band is:", myFavouriteBand)

# Example of global variable and local variable with the same name
myFavouriteBand = "AC/DC"
def getBandRating(bandname):
    myFavouriteBand = "Deep Purple"
    if bandname == myFavouriteBand:
        return 10.0
    else:
        return 0.0
print("AC/DC's rating is:",getBandRating("AC/DC"))
print("Deep Purple's rating is: ",getBandRating("Deep Purple"))
print("My favourite band is:",myFavouriteBand)
#two myFavouriteBand variable definitions, first one of these has a global scope
#the second of them is a local variable
#Deep Purple will receive a rating of 10.0 when passed to the getBandRating function
#outside of the getBandRating function, the getBandRating s local variable is not defined

# Collections and Functions
# When the number of arguments are unknown for a function, They can all be packed into a tuple as shown
def printAll(*args): # All the arguments are 'packed' into args which can be treated like a tuple
    print("No of arguments:", len(args)) 
    for argument in args:
        print(argument)
#printAll with 3 arguments
printAll('Horsefeather','Adonis','Bone')
#printAll with 4 arguments
printAll('Sidecar','Long Island','Mudslide','Carriage')

#No of arguments: 3
#Horsefeather
#Adonis
#Bone

#No of arguments: 4
#Sidecar
#Long Island
#Mudslide
#Carriage

#Functions can be incredibly powerful and versatile
#They can accept (and return) data types, objects and even other functions as arguments. 
def addItems(list):
    list.append("Three")
    list.append("Four")

myList = ["One","Two"]

Quiz on Functions

Come up with a function that divides the first input by the second input
def div(a, b):
    return(a/b)

Use the function con for the following question
def con(a, b):
    return(a + b)

#What is an Exception?
#An exception is an error that occurs during the execution of code
#This error causes the code to raise an exception and if not prepared to handle it will halt the execution of the code.
#Examples:
1/0 #ZeroDivisionError occurs when you try to divide by zero
y = a + 5 #NameError use the variable a when it was not defined
a = [1, 2, 3]
a[10] #IndexError tried to access data from a list using an index that does not exist for this list

#Exception Handling
#A try except will allow you to execute code that might raise an exception 
#and in the case of any exception or a specific one we can handle or catch the exception and execute specific code
#This will allow us to continue the execution of our program even if there is an exception

#Python tries to execute the code in the try block 
#In this case if there is any exception raised by the code in the try block, 
#it will be caught and the code block in the except block will be executed 
#After that, the code that comes after the try except will be executed

a = 1
try:
    b = int(input("Please enter a number to divide a"))
    a = a/b
    print("Success a=",a)
except:
    print("There was an error")        
#Please enter a number to divide a 5
#Success a= 0.2

#Try Except Specific
#A specific try except allows you to catch certain exceptions and also execute certain code depending on the exception 
#This is useful if you do not want to deal with some exceptions and the execution should halt 
#It can also help you find errors in your code that you might not be aware of 
#Furthermore, it can help you differentiate responses to different exceptions 
#In this case, the code after the try except might not run depending on the error
a = 1
try:
    b = int(input("Please enter a number to divide a"))
    a = a/b
    print("Success a=",a)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("The number you provided cant divide 1 because it is 0")
except ValueError:
    print("You did not provide a number")
except:
    print("Something went wrong")
#Please enter a number to divide a 8
#Success a= 0.125

#Please enter a number to divide a 
#You did not provide a number

#Please enter a number to divide a 0
#The number you provided cant divide 1 because it is 0

#Try Except Else and Finally
#else allows one to check if there was no exception when executing the try block 
#this is useful when we want to execute something only if there were no errors
a = 1
try:
    b = int(input("Please enter a number to divide a"))
    a = a/b
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("The number you provided cant divide 1 because it is 0")
except ValueError:
    print("You did not provide a number")
except:
    print("Something went wrong")
else:
    print("success a=",a)
finally:
    print("Processing Complete")
#Please enter a number to divide a 5
#success a= 0.2
#Processing Complete

#Please enter a number to divide a 
#You did not provide a number
#Processing Complete

#Exercise
def safe_divide(numerator,denominator):
    try:
        result = numerator / denominator
        return result
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Error: Cannot divide by zero.")
        return None
# Test case
numerator=int(input("Enter the numerator value:-"))
denominator=int(input("Enter the denominator value:-"))
print(safe_divide(numerator,denominator)) 
#Enter the numerator value:- 3
#Enter the denominator value:- 2
#1.5
