#we can concatenate strings

Branching (if else elif statements)
Branching allows us to run different statements for different inputs

# If statement example
age = 19
#expression that can be true or false
if age > 18:
    #expression that is run if the condition is true
    print("you can enter" ) #you can enter
#The statements after the if statement will run regardless if the condition is true or false 
print("move on")

#The else statement runs a block of code if none of the conditions are True before it 
# Else statement example
age2 = 18

if age2 > 18:
    print("you can enter" )
else:
    print("go see Meat Loaf" ) # go see Meat Loaf
print("move on")

#The elif statement, short for else if, allows us to check
#additional conditions if the condition statements before it are False

# Elif statment example
age3 = 18

if age3 > 18:
    print("you can enter" )
elif age3 == 18:
    print("go see Pink Floyd")
else:
    print("go see Meat Loaf" )

print("move on")


# Condition statement example
album_year = 1983

if album_year > 1980:
    print("Album year is greater than 1980")
else:
    print("less than 1980")

print('do something..')

# Logical operators
# used when you want to compare more than one condition
# and, or, not
#The and statement is only True when both conditions are true
# Condition statement example
album_year3 = 1990

if(album_year3 < 1980) or (album_year3 > 1989):
    print ("Album was not made in the 1980's")
else:

# Condition statement example

#QUIZ
#Write an if statement to determine if an album had a rating greater than 8

#Loops in Python
#repeated executions are performed by loops

#What is for loop?
#The for loop enables you to execute a code block multiple times
# For loop example

# Loop through the list and iterate on both index and element value
squares=['red', 'yellow', 'green', 'purple', 'blue']

#What is while loop
#keep executing a code block until a certain condition is met
# While Loop Example
